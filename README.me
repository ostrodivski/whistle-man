This was my TIPE project during my second year of classes pr√©pas. The game responds to variations of pitch : basically, the steeper it is, the faster you go (with respect to the y axis).

This programm requires the SFML library and fftw3 (to compute Fast Fourier Transforms) in order to work.

This programm uses Poly2Tri, which is under copyright license.
